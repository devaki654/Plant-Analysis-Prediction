 Plant Analysis & Prediction
The **Plant Analysis & Prediction** system is designed to analyze plant leaves, detect diseases, and predict their health condition using deep learning. It utilizes a **PyTorch-based model** for predictions, a **Flask backend** to handle processing, and a **HTML/CSS frontend** for user interaction.

---

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (for UI and styling)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask for API handling)
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch (for model training and inference)
- **Database (Optional):** MongoDB or SQLite (for storing plant analysis data)
- **Deployment:** Flask server, possible cloud hosting (Heroku, AWS, or Firebase)

---

### **Project Features**
1. **Image Upload:**
   - Users can upload plant leaf images through the web interface.

2. **Plant Health Detection:**
   - The system processes the image using a PyTorch-trained model.
   - It predicts whether the plant is **healthy** or has diseases like **rust, powdery mildew, or spots**.

3. **Result Display:**
   - The frontend shows the **predicted disease category** and **confidence score**.
   - If necessary, it suggests possible treatments.

4. **Database Integration (Optional):**
   - Store analyzed images and predictions in a database for future reference.

5. **API Support:**
   - Flask API to process images and return predictions.

### **Workflow**
1. **User uploads a plant leaf image** on the web interface.
2. The image is sent to the **Flask backend**.
3. The **PyTorch model** loads and makes a prediction.
4. The result is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.
5. (Optional) Prediction data is stored in **MongoDB** for analysis.

### **Next Steps**
- Do you already have a trained PyTorch model, or do you need help training one?
- Do you want a real-time camera-based detection feature?
- Should I help you structure the project files? ðŸš€
